<h1 class="one">How did Web Design help me?</h1>

<div>
  <p class="center grid-container border p4">Web Design helped me in many ways, one way that I found out was that you need to devote a lot of time to designing a page!  Next, I learned new and very interesting things about
  computers, in that coding and designing has to be done online.  Initially, all I wanted to do was to mess around and listen to music.  Which I found out was a bad idea!  However I discovered that it was very tricky at the end.</P>

  <p class="center grid-container border p4">While making this website I struggled a lot since initially I did not devote enough time to creating it.  At the beginning of
  this class I found that I didn't understand any of it!  I wanted to give up!  Who would have thought this class would be so very challenging?  I had no idea!
  But now at the end it all turned out well and I feel very pleased and good about the fact that I have actually created my very own webpage! </p>

<div>
<p class="center grid-container border p4">I used to think that coding was a way to get anything you want.  I don't really
  understand why I thought that about coding, but again I learned a great deal during this process.
