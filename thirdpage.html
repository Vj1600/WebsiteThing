<div>
  Making a website helped me very much cause I learned a lot of new things
    from computers, to coding and to desgining online. It was very tricky at
    first but I pulled through I wanted to just mess around and listen to music and
    have no energy to make this website.

  <p>While making this website, I struggled a lot. At the start of
  this class, I didn't get any of this coding biz. I wanted to give up
  which is funny to me cause I hate giving up. I think you and others agree on giving up
  isn't a option.</p>

  <p>I used to like coding so much though
  when I was little cause I used to want to be a game coder. I can't exactly remember
  but like how I said on my second page, I like and still do have a big intrest on video games.</p>
