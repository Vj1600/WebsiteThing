  <main>

<p> As of making this website, I had some hard times and even times
  where I wanted to give up. Ever since 2nd grade I though about being
  a game designer and back thehn when I did the research It was more
  than I thought. Coding is very fun even though It takes some time. A lot of time to be exact. I learned
while making this website that not only you will get to learn coding, but also dedication.</p>

<p>In conclusion, making a website was very hard at some times but during
it was all fun. The people also in the class were very helpful here and there
and I struggled so many times that took me to a point to work harder and
hoped the website turned out good. I hope you enjoyed
my website becauser I now know how it feels to make one!</p>
