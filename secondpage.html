<h1 class="one">What are some things I find amusing?</h1>
 <main>

   <p class="center grid-container border p3">Playing videogames and listening to music are a small amount of things
that I find intriguing.  Hearing music will always get me back in good spirits!  Lil Uzi Vert is an artist that I enjoy listening to while waiting and anticipating any new music he plans to drop.
He's my Favorite Rapper of all time!  I'm known for being a fan when it comes to him. </p>

     <div>
     <p class="center grid-container border p3"> Other artists I recommend are Playboi Carti along with Tyler, The Creator just to name a few.
       Carti's rapid word use and Tyler's quick-witted references continue to inspire young people like myself, one at a time.</p>

   <div>
      <p class="center grid-container border p3">The videogames that I play are combat games that can include a lot of shooting.
        Personally I prefer Sonic or Kirby games at this time.  I consider myself a "Videogame Expert" even at some of the un-popular games that are out now.
