<h1>Hello World</h1>
<p>Hi. I am this website creator. I like to rap and sing on my alone time and somtimes even dance.
I'm very goofy and I really can't take things seriously.
Also im surprised I was able to make a website at all. I like to play Basketball
and Volleyball and I'm good at both of it. When I was young I was a young tech junky
and to this day I'm still am. Well, somewhat. </p>
<br>
<h2>What are things I like to do</h2>
<p>I like to play Video Games whenever I get the chance and I like to run.
I like running a lot honestly. I also like watching anime. I watched so much Anime
that whenever I stand, I stand in a stance. I also like listening to music a lot
and it helps me, and a lot of other people in the world. </p>
