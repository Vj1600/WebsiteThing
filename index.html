<h1 class="one">About me</h1>

      <main>
    <div>
<p class="center grid-container border p2">Some things to know about me are that I like to rap, sing, dance and can be very goofy at times!  Not taking things seriously at all!
I like to play basketball and volleyball.  I will be trying out for the volleyball team in the Spring!
A couple of years ago I was a tech junky, to this day I still am.</p>

  <div>
<p class="center grid-container border p2 space">I attend a very
populated school in Ohio.  This website has no theme other than it's all about me!  It's just a fun website!
Even though people keep asking me about a specific theme, I thought telling people a little about me would be interesting!</p>

  I really enjoyed it!</p>
