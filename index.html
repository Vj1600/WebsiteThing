<p>Hello reader! I like to rap and sing on my alone time and sometimes even dance.
I'm very goofy and I really can't take things seriously.
Also I'm surprised I was able to make a website at all. I like to play Basketball
and Volleyball and I'm good at both of it. When I was young I was a young tech junky
and to this day I'm still am. Well, somewhat. Most of the time.</p>

<p> The website that you are on has no theme, or certian topic
  i'm going to go over but this is just a fun website I made. Even though
people keeps asking me, "Shouldn't you have a theme?". I say, "Yes, I should"
so you can think of this website is about me.</p>

     <div>
  <p>This very website took a little while to make but in the time it was also
    very fun. I had a lot of enjoyment while making it. Even though I almsot dropped
    this class.</p>
