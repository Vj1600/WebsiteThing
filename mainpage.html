<h1 class="grid-container border">Why hello there!</h1>

  <p>Welcome to my website! I've been working on this website ever since school started for me
  in August. The class i've learned this in taught me a lot. Plus coding is very more harder
   if you think about it. My website doesn't exactly have a theme. But I just
  thought that some will like to know about me. It's creator. I shall give a brief
     intoduction on myself.</p>

<p>My name is Justin C. Bennett and I'm 14. (will be 15 in December) I go to Licking Heights High School.
I'm a very interesting and somewhat of a confusing person. It took me some trouble with making this website
because I started off on a wrong foot. Also, this website brought me a lot of ups and downs while making it.
I hope you enjoy going through my website while learning about me. I hope you enjot this website!</p>
