<h1 class="one">Why hello there!</h1>



  <p class="center flex-container border up p1">Welcome to my website everyone!  Ever since school started for me I have been working
    on this for months.  The class I've learned this in taught me a lot as well.  Plus coding is simpler
    then tricky if you think about it.  My website doesn't exactly have a theme but I thought
thought that some would like to know more about me.  I'll give a brief introduction of myself.</p>

<p class="grid-container border box over footer p1">My name is Justin C. Bennett and I'm 15 (Just turned 15 in December).
I go to Licking Heights High School. I'm a very interesting of a person. It took me some troubles with making this website
because I started off on a wrong foot. Also, this website brought me to a lot of ups and downs while making it.
Because of that, I hope you enjoy going through it. Now onward!</p>
